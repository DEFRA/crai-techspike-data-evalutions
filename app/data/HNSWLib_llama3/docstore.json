Some projects dedicated more resources than anticipated on background \nresearch, which in some cases resulted in changed project aims.  \nThe size of investment required by completed Round 1 projects varies depending on pro-\nject location, size, cost of the restoration required and cost of ongoing research activities.  \nConclusion \nThe NEIRF programme has been set up well to test different revenue streams for natural \ncapital businesses.

Other enablers included a large delivery team, for example where projects are \nled by consortia, which facilitated the involvement of a range of experts; and relationships \ndeveloped through the NEIRF network, for example links to potential buyers. \nCoordination across among all the stakeholders involved was key to    project progress.","metadata":{"source":"/home/node/app/routes/../data/NEIRF/15889_NEIRF_YR_2_REPORT_FINAL_FORMATTED.PDF","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Research report template","Author":"SMITH, Jason","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","CreationDate":"D:20230728131438+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20230728132734+01'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:createdate":"2023-07-28T13:14:38+01:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:creatortool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:58df3b50-f7cf-4ddf-b3d1-4383a53b948e","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4f64431-5c6e-424c-8d99-913a8c07ef77","xmpmm:subject":"26","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"Research report template","dc:description":"","dc:creator":"SMITH, Jason","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","pdf:keywords":"","pdfx:sourcemodified":"","pdfx:company":"","pdfx:comments":"","pdfx:contenttype":"IWP Document","pdfx:contenttypeid":"0x010100A5BF1C78D9F64B679A5EBDE1C6598EBC010055B29FE951C5FD47B141D9D0F82DBC9B","pdfx:_dlc_dociditemguid":"453ced71-93fc-46de-989b-09d563bcdfe0","pdfx:iwporganisationalunit":"3;#DfE|cc08a6d4-dfde-4d0f-bd85-069ebcef80d5","pdfx:iwpowner":"1;#DfE|a484111e-5b24-4ad9-9778-c536c8c88985","pdfx:iwpsubject":"","pdfx:iwpfunction":"","pdfx:iwpsitetype":"","pdfx:iwprightsprotectivemarking":"2;#Official|0884c477-2e62-47ea-b19c-5af6e91124c5","pdfx:informationtype":"","pdfx:distribution":"14;#Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:securityclassification":"","pdfx:hocopyrightlevel":"7;#Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:hogovernmentsecurityclassification":"6;#Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:hositetype":"11;#Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:organisationalunit":"17;#Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:directorate":"","pdfx:lae2bfa7b6474897ab4a53f76ea236c7":"Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:k85d23755b3a46b5a51451cf336b2e9b":"","pdfx:fe59e9859d6a491389c5b03567f5dda5":"Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:cf401361b24e474cb011be6eb76c0e76":"Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:n7493b4506bf40e28c373b1e51a33445":"Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:ddeb1fd0a9ad4436a96525d34737dc44":"Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:taxcatchall":"6;#;#10;#;#9;#;#8;#;#7;#","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_enabled":"true","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_setdate":"2022-04-26T12:36:22Z","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_method":"Standard","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_name":"65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_siteid":"efaa16aa-d1de-4d58-ba2e-2833fdfdd29f","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_actionid":"eff85d9f-09ce-430a-93d0-dd8d7baaac73","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_contentbits":"1","pdfx:mediaserviceimagetags":"","pdfx:lcf76f155ced4ddcb4097134ff3c332f":"","pdfx:order":"468000.000000","pdfx:hofrom":"","pdfx:xd_progid":"","pdfx:complianceassetid":"","pdfx:templateurl":"","pdfx:hocc":"","pdfx:vti_imgdate":"","pdfx:_extendeddescription":"","pdfx:triggerflowinfo":"","pdfx:hoto":"","pdfx:hosubject":"","pdfx:xd_signature":"0","pdfx:wic_system_copyright":""}},"totalPages":169},"loc":{"pageNumber":13,"lines":{"from":34,"to":44}}}}],["428",{"pageContent":"14 \n \nBarriers included policy uncertainties, recruitment challenges, and engaging stakeholders \nsuch as landowners. \nProjects made mixed progress towards developing revenue-generating activities and \ndeveloping codes.

Year 3 of the evaluation may \nbenefit from the inclusion of additional in-person interviews and observation \nactivities, which may also help with the development of case studies.","metadata":{"source":"/home/node/app/routes/../data/NEIRF/15889_NEIRF_YR_2_REPORT_FINAL_FORMATTED.PDF","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Research report template","Author":"SMITH, Jason","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","CreationDate":"D:20230728131438+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20230728132734+01'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:createdate":"2023-07-28T13:14:38+01:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:creatortool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:58df3b50-f7cf-4ddf-b3d1-4383a53b948e","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4f64431-5c6e-424c-8d99-913a8c07ef77","xmpmm:subject":"26","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"Research report template","dc:description":"","dc:creator":"SMITH, Jason","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","pdf:keywords":"","pdfx:sourcemodified":"","pdfx:company":"","pdfx:comments":"","pdfx:contenttype":"IWP Document","pdfx:contenttypeid":"0x010100A5BF1C78D9F64B679A5EBDE1C6598EBC010055B29FE951C5FD47B141D9D0F82DBC9B","pdfx:_dlc_dociditemguid":"453ced71-93fc-46de-989b-09d563bcdfe0","pdfx:iwporganisationalunit":"3;#DfE|cc08a6d4-dfde-4d0f-bd85-069ebcef80d5","pdfx:iwpowner":"1;#DfE|a484111e-5b24-4ad9-9778-c536c8c88985","pdfx:iwpsubject":"","pdfx:iwpfunction":"","pdfx:iwpsitetype":"","pdfx:iwprightsprotectivemarking":"2;#Official|0884c477-2e62-47ea-b19c-5af6e91124c5","pdfx:informationtype":"","pdfx:distribution":"14;#Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:securityclassification":"","pdfx:hocopyrightlevel":"7;#Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:hogovernmentsecurityclassification":"6;#Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:hositetype":"11;#Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:organisationalunit":"17;#Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:directorate":"","pdfx:lae2bfa7b6474897ab4a53f76ea236c7":"Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:k85d23755b3a46b5a51451cf336b2e9b":"","pdfx:fe59e9859d6a491389c5b03567f5dda5":"Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:cf401361b24e474cb011be6eb76c0e76":"Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:n7493b4506bf40e28c373b1e51a33445":"Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:ddeb1fd0a9ad4436a96525d34737dc44":"Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:taxcatchall":"6;#;#10;#;#9;#;#8;#;#7;#","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_enabled":"true","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_setdate":"2022-04-26T12:36:22Z","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_method":"Standard","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_name":"65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_siteid":"efaa16aa-d1de-4d58-ba2e-2833fdfdd29f","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_actionid":"eff85d9f-09ce-430a-93d0-dd8d7baaac73","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_contentbits":"1","pdfx:mediaserviceimagetags":"","pdfx:lcf76f155ced4ddcb4097134ff3c332f":"","pdfx:order":"468000.000000","pdfx:hofrom":"","pdfx:xd_progid":"","pdfx:complianceassetid":"","pdfx:templateurl":"","pdfx:hocc":"","pdfx:vti_imgdate":"","pdfx:_extendeddescription":"","pdfx:triggerflowinfo":"","pdfx:hoto":"","pdfx:hosubject":"","pdfx:xd_signature":"0","pdfx:wic_system_copyright":""}},"totalPages":169},"loc":{"pageNumber":22,"lines":{"from":34,"to":46}}}}],["458",{"pageContent":"23 \n \n• The evaluation will be able to produce strong evidence at the project, system and \npolicy levels.

It is encouraging to see that more private \ncompanies were funded in Round 2, as it further expands the range of projects and \ncompensates for the lower number in Round 1. This was a consequence of targeted \nmarket engagement with private companies, showing that Defra successfully adapted the \nprogramme between Rounds. \nThe variety of funded projects means the NEIRF provides a good opportunity to test \ndifferent revenue models in different contexts and understand the key enablers and \nbarriers and which approaches are most effective.","metadata":{"source":"/home/node/app/routes/../data/NEIRF/15889_NEIRF_YR_2_REPORT_FINAL_FORMATTED.PDF","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Research report template","Author":"SMITH, Jason","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","CreationDate":"D:20230728131438+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20230728132734+01'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:createdate":"2023-07-28T13:14:38+01:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:creatortool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:58df3b50-f7cf-4ddf-b3d1-4383a53b948e","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4f64431-5c6e-424c-8d99-913a8c07ef77","xmpmm:subject":"26","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"Research report template","dc:description":"","dc:creator":"SMITH, Jason","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","pdf:keywords":"","pdfx:sourcemodified":"","pdfx:company":"","pdfx:comments":"","pdfx:contenttype":"IWP Document","pdfx:contenttypeid":"0x010100A5BF1C78D9F64B679A5EBDE1C6598EBC010055B29FE951C5FD47B141D9D0F82DBC9B","pdfx:_dlc_dociditemguid":"453ced71-93fc-46de-989b-09d563bcdfe0","pdfx:iwporganisationalunit":"3;#DfE|cc08a6d4-dfde-4d0f-bd85-069ebcef80d5","pdfx:iwpowner":"1;#DfE|a484111e-5b24-4ad9-9778-c536c8c88985","pdfx:iwpsubject":"","pdfx:iwpfunction":"","pdfx:iwpsitetype":"","pdfx:iwprightsprotectivemarking":"2;#Official|0884c477-2e62-47ea-b19c-5af6e91124c5","pdfx:informationtype":"","pdfx:distribution":"14;#Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:securityclassification":"","pdfx:hocopyrightlevel":"7;#Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:hogovernmentsecurityclassification":"6;#Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:hositetype":"11;#Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:organisationalunit":"17;#Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:directorate":"","pdfx:lae2bfa7b6474897ab4a53f76ea236c7":"Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:k85d23755b3a46b5a51451cf336b2e9b":"","pdfx:fe59e9859d6a491389c5b03567f5dda5":"Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:cf401361b24e474cb011be6eb76c0e76":"Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:n7493b4506bf40e28c373b1e51a33445":"Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:ddeb1fd0a9ad4436a96525d34737dc44":"Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:taxcatchall":"6;#;#10;#;#9;#;#8;#;#7;#","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_enabled":"true","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_setdate":"2022-04-26T12:36:22Z","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_method":"Standard","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_name":"65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_siteid":"efaa16aa-d1de-4d58-ba2e-2833fdfdd29f","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_actionid":"eff85d9f-09ce-430a-93d0-dd8d7baaac73","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_contentbits":"1","pdfx:mediaserviceimagetags":"","pdfx:lcf76f155ced4ddcb4097134ff3c332f":"","pdfx:order":"468000.000000","pdfx:hofrom":"","pdfx:xd_progid":"","pdfx:complianceassetid":"","pdfx:templateurl":"","pdfx:hocc":"","pdfx:vti_imgdate":"","pdfx:_extendeddescription":"","pdfx:triggerflowinfo":"","pdfx:hoto":"","pdfx:hosubject":"","pdfx:xd_signature":"0","pdfx:wic_system_copyright":""}},"totalPages":169},"loc":{"pageNumber":34,"lines":{"from":13,"to":25}}}}],["491",{"pageContent":"35 \n \n4   Project implementation \n \n \n  \nSummary \nProject delivery \n• Projects’ progress against their outcomes is mixed; they are on track to deliver \nsome of their outcomes but struggling in other areas.

The reasons for not \nimplementing projects as planned included lack of investment opportunities, challenges \naround staff capacity or skills, partnership issues, supply chain issues, changes in \ntimeline, policy drivers, and land manager readiness.","metadata":{"source":"/home/node/app/routes/../data/NEIRF/15889_NEIRF_YR_2_REPORT_FINAL_FORMATTED.PDF","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Research report template","Author":"SMITH, Jason","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","CreationDate":"D:20230728131438+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20230728132734+01'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:createdate":"2023-07-28T13:14:38+01:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:creatortool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:58df3b50-f7cf-4ddf-b3d1-4383a53b948e","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4f64431-5c6e-424c-8d99-913a8c07ef77","xmpmm:subject":"26","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"Research report template","dc:description":"","dc:creator":"SMITH, Jason","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","pdf:keywords":"","pdfx:sourcemodified":"","pdfx:company":"","pdfx:comments":"","pdfx:contenttype":"IWP Document","pdfx:contenttypeid":"0x010100A5BF1C78D9F64B679A5EBDE1C6598EBC010055B29FE951C5FD47B141D9D0F82DBC9B","pdfx:_dlc_dociditemguid":"453ced71-93fc-46de-989b-09d563bcdfe0","pdfx:iwporganisationalunit":"3;#DfE|cc08a6d4-dfde-4d0f-bd85-069ebcef80d5","pdfx:iwpowner":"1;#DfE|a484111e-5b24-4ad9-9778-c536c8c88985","pdfx:iwpsubject":"","pdfx:iwpfunction":"","pdfx:iwpsitetype":"","pdfx:iwprightsprotectivemarking":"2;#Official|0884c477-2e62-47ea-b19c-5af6e91124c5","pdfx:informationtype":"","pdfx:distribution":"14;#Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:securityclassification":"","pdfx:hocopyrightlevel":"7;#Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:hogovernmentsecurityclassification":"6;#Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:hositetype":"11;#Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:organisationalunit":"17;#Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:directorate":"","pdfx:lae2bfa7b6474897ab4a53f76ea236c7":"Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:k85d23755b3a46b5a51451cf336b2e9b":"","pdfx:fe59e9859d6a491389c5b03567f5dda5":"Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:cf401361b24e474cb011be6eb76c0e76":"Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:n7493b4506bf40e28c373b1e51a33445":"Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:ddeb1fd0a9ad4436a96525d34737dc44":"Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:taxcatchall":"6;#;#10;#;#9;#;#8;#;#7;#","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_enabled":"true","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_setdate":"2022-04-26T12:36:22Z","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_method":"Standard","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_name":"65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_siteid":"efaa16aa-d1de-4d58-ba2e-2833fdfdd29f","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_actionid":"eff85d9f-09ce-430a-93d0-dd8d7baaac73","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_contentbits":"1","pdfx:mediaserviceimagetags":"","pdfx:lcf76f155ced4ddcb4097134ff3c332f":"","pdfx:order":"468000.000000","pdfx:hofrom":"","pdfx:xd_progid":"","pdfx:complianceassetid":"","pdfx:templateurl":"","pdfx:hocc":"","pdfx:vti_imgdate":"","pdfx:_extendeddescription":"","pdfx:triggerflowinfo":"","pdfx:hoto":"","pdfx:hosubject":"","pdfx:xd_signature":"0","pdfx:wic_system_copyright":""}},"totalPages":169},"loc":{"pageNumber":36,"lines":{"from":1,"to":14}}}}],["494",{"pageContent":"around staff capacity or skills, partnership issues, supply chain issues, changes in \ntimeline, policy drivers, and land manager readiness. \nInterviews suggested that in some cases Round 1 projects adapted their delivery plans \nbased on lessons learned during scoping, suggesting that perhaps an initial scoping \nphase could be designed into the NEIRF as part of early delivery.

Some interviewees felt additional rounds of NEIRF would help to continue \nbuilding the pipeline of revenue-generating projects.","metadata":{"source":"/home/node/app/routes/../data/NEIRF/15889_NEIRF_YR_2_REPORT_FINAL_FORMATTED.PDF","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Research report template","Author":"SMITH, Jason","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","CreationDate":"D:20230728131438+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20230728132734+01'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:createdate":"2023-07-28T13:14:38+01:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:creatortool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:58df3b50-f7cf-4ddf-b3d1-4383a53b948e","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4f64431-5c6e-424c-8d99-913a8c07ef77","xmpmm:subject":"26","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"Research report template","dc:description":"","dc:creator":"SMITH, Jason","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","pdf:keywords":"","pdfx:sourcemodified":"","pdfx:company":"","pdfx:comments":"","pdfx:contenttype":"IWP Document","pdfx:contenttypeid":"0x010100A5BF1C78D9F64B679A5EBDE1C6598EBC010055B29FE951C5FD47B141D9D0F82DBC9B","pdfx:_dlc_dociditemguid":"453ced71-93fc-46de-989b-09d563bcdfe0","pdfx:iwporganisationalunit":"3;#DfE|cc08a6d4-dfde-4d0f-bd85-069ebcef80d5","pdfx:iwpowner":"1;#DfE|a484111e-5b24-4ad9-9778-c536c8c88985","pdfx:iwpsubject":"","pdfx:iwpfunction":"","pdfx:iwpsitetype":"","pdfx:iwprightsprotectivemarking":"2;#Official|0884c477-2e62-47ea-b19c-5af6e91124c5","pdfx:informationtype":"","pdfx:distribution":"14;#Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:securityclassification":"","pdfx:hocopyrightlevel":"7;#Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:hogovernmentsecurityclassification":"6;#Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:hositetype":"11;#Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:organisationalunit":"17;#Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:directorate":"","pdfx:lae2bfa7b6474897ab4a53f76ea236c7":"Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:k85d23755b3a46b5a51451cf336b2e9b":"","pdfx:fe59e9859d6a491389c5b03567f5dda5":"Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:cf401361b24e474cb011be6eb76c0e76":"Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:n7493b4506bf40e28c373b1e51a33445":"Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:ddeb1fd0a9ad4436a96525d34737dc44":"Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:taxcatchall":"6;#;#10;#;#9;#;#8;#;#7;#","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_enabled":"true","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_setdate":"2022-04-26T12:36:22Z","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_method":"Standard","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_name":"65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_siteid":"efaa16aa-d1de-4d58-ba2e-2833fdfdd29f","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_actionid":"eff85d9f-09ce-430a-93d0-dd8d7baaac73","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_contentbits":"1","pdfx:mediaserviceimagetags":"","pdfx:lcf76f155ced4ddcb4097134ff3c332f":"","pdfx:order":"468000.000000","pdfx:hofrom":"","pdfx:xd_progid":"","pdfx:complianceassetid":"","pdfx:templateurl":"","pdfx:hocc":"","pdfx:vti_imgdate":"","pdfx:_extendeddescription":"","pdfx:triggerflowinfo":"","pdfx:hoto":"","pdfx:hosubject":"","pdfx:xd_signature":"0","pdfx:wic_system_copyright":""}},"totalPages":169},"loc":{"pageNumber":36,"lines":{"from":33,"to":43}}}}],["497",{"pageContent":"37 \n \n4.2 Implementation support \nNEIRF grantees are offered wide ranging support from Defra, the EA and NE \nthroughout project implementation, including a NEIRF SharePoint site and dedicated \nMicrosoft Teams channel, webinars on grant requirements (e.g. claim forms, evaluation, \nreporting) one-to-one telephone and email support from project advisors, and a CoP to \nnetwork and share learning.

Events \nincluded Water Management, Codes & Standards, Peatland, Coast & Marine discussion \ngroups, a Wilder Carbon webinar and Conservation covenants session.","metadata":{"source":"/home/node/app/routes/../data/NEIRF/15889_NEIRF_YR_2_REPORT_FINAL_FORMATTED.PDF","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Research report template","Author":"SMITH, Jason","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","CreationDate":"D:20230728131438+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20230728132734+01'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:createdate":"2023-07-28T13:14:38+01:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:creatortool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:58df3b50-f7cf-4ddf-b3d1-4383a53b948e","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4f64431-5c6e-424c-8d99-913a8c07ef77","xmpmm:subject":"26","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"Research report template","dc:description":"","dc:creator":"SMITH, Jason","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","pdf:keywords":"","pdfx:sourcemodified":"","pdfx:company":"","pdfx:comments":"","pdfx:contenttype":"IWP Document","pdfx:contenttypeid":"0x010100A5BF1C78D9F64B679A5EBDE1C6598EBC010055B29FE951C5FD47B141D9D0F82DBC9B","pdfx:_dlc_dociditemguid":"453ced71-93fc-46de-989b-09d563bcdfe0","pdfx:iwporganisationalunit":"3;#DfE|cc08a6d4-dfde-4d0f-bd85-069ebcef80d5","pdfx:iwpowner":"1;#DfE|a484111e-5b24-4ad9-9778-c536c8c88985","pdfx:iwpsubject":"","pdfx:iwpfunction":"","pdfx:iwpsitetype":"","pdfx:iwprightsprotectivemarking":"2;#Official|0884c477-2e62-47ea-b19c-5af6e91124c5","pdfx:informationtype":"","pdfx:distribution":"14;#Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:securityclassification":"","pdfx:hocopyrightlevel":"7;#Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:hogovernmentsecurityclassification":"6;#Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:hositetype":"11;#Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:organisationalunit":"17;#Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:directorate":"","pdfx:lae2bfa7b6474897ab4a53f76ea236c7":"Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:k85d23755b3a46b5a51451cf336b2e9b":"","pdfx:fe59e9859d6a491389c5b03567f5dda5":"Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:cf401361b24e474cb011be6eb76c0e76":"Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:n7493b4506bf40e28c373b1e51a33445":"Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:ddeb1fd0a9ad4436a96525d34737dc44":"Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:taxcatchall":"6;#;#10;#;#9;#;#8;#;#7;#","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_enabled":"true","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_setdate":"2022-04-26T12:36:22Z","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_method":"Standard","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_name":"65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_siteid":"efaa16aa-d1de-4d58-ba2e-2833fdfdd29f","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_actionid":"eff85d9f-09ce-430a-93d0-dd8d7baaac73","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_contentbits":"1","pdfx:mediaserviceimagetags":"","pdfx:lcf76f155ced4ddcb4097134ff3c332f":"","pdfx:order":"468000.000000","pdfx:hofrom":"","pdfx:xd_progid":"","pdfx:complianceassetid":"","pdfx:templateurl":"","pdfx:hocc":"","pdfx:vti_imgdate":"","pdfx:_extendeddescription":"","pdfx:triggerflowinfo":"","pdfx:hoto":"","pdfx:hosubject":"","pdfx:xd_signature":"0","pdfx:wic_system_copyright":""}},"totalPages":169},"loc":{"pageNumber":38,"lines":{"from":33,"to":42}}}}],["504",{"pageContent":"39 \n \n It is worth noting that data should be treated with some caution as there are likely to be \nrecall issues when asking projects to rate a list of events attended over the course of one \nyear. \nFindings from interviews and the survey show that grantees were satisfied with the CoP \nand thought it enriched their NEIRF experience and provided valuable learning and \nknowledge sharing opportunities. \n“Overall it has all been very positive and [I] have been impressed with the depth \nand breadth of discussions and topics via the Community of Practice discussion \ngroups.” – Survey respondent \nGrantees valued being able to share their learning and exchange best practices with \nstakeholders who were working on similar projects to theirs.

As such, ranges of unit sale \nand revenue estimates can be large, making robustly forecasting future revenue \nchallenging.","metadata":{"source":"/home/node/app/routes/../data/NEIRF/15889_NEIRF_YR_2_REPORT_FINAL_FORMATTED.PDF","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Research report template","Author":"SMITH, Jason","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","CreationDate":"D:20230728131438+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20230728132734+01'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:createdate":"2023-07-28T13:14:38+01:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:creatortool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:58df3b50-f7cf-4ddf-b3d1-4383a53b948e","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4f64431-5c6e-424c-8d99-913a8c07ef77","xmpmm:subject":"26","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"Research report template","dc:description":"","dc:creator":"SMITH, Jason","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","pdf:keywords":"","pdfx:sourcemodified":"","pdfx:company":"","pdfx:comments":"","pdfx:contenttype":"IWP Document","pdfx:contenttypeid":"0x010100A5BF1C78D9F64B679A5EBDE1C6598EBC010055B29FE951C5FD47B141D9D0F82DBC9B","pdfx:_dlc_dociditemguid":"453ced71-93fc-46de-989b-09d563bcdfe0","pdfx:iwporganisationalunit":"3;#DfE|cc08a6d4-dfde-4d0f-bd85-069ebcef80d5","pdfx:iwpowner":"1;#DfE|a484111e-5b24-4ad9-9778-c536c8c88985","pdfx:iwpsubject":"","pdfx:iwpfunction":"","pdfx:iwpsitetype":"","pdfx:iwprightsprotectivemarking":"2;#Official|0884c477-2e62-47ea-b19c-5af6e91124c5","pdfx:informationtype":"","pdfx:distribution":"14;#Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:securityclassification":"","pdfx:hocopyrightlevel":"7;#Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:hogovernmentsecurityclassification":"6;#Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:hositetype":"11;#Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:organisationalunit":"17;#Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:directorate":"","pdfx:lae2bfa7b6474897ab4a53f76ea236c7":"Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:k85d23755b3a46b5a51451cf336b2e9b":"","pdfx:fe59e9859d6a491389c5b03567f5dda5":"Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:cf401361b24e474cb011be6eb76c0e76":"Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:n7493b4506bf40e28c373b1e51a33445":"Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:ddeb1fd0a9ad4436a96525d34737dc44":"Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:taxcatchall":"6;#;#10;#;#9;#;#8;#;#7;#","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_enabled":"true","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_setdate":"2022-04-26T12:36:22Z","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_method":"Standard","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_name":"65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_siteid":"efaa16aa-d1de-4d58-ba2e-2833fdfdd29f","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_actionid":"eff85d9f-09ce-430a-93d0-dd8d7baaac73","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_contentbits":"1","pdfx:mediaserviceimagetags":"","pdfx:lcf76f155ced4ddcb4097134ff3c332f":"","pdfx:order":"468000.000000","pdfx:hofrom":"","pdfx:xd_progid":"","pdfx:complianceassetid":"","pdfx:templateurl":"","pdfx:hocc":"","pdfx:vti_imgdate":"","pdfx:_extendeddescription":"","pdfx:triggerflowinfo":"","pdfx:hoto":"","pdfx:hosubject":"","pdfx:xd_signature":"0","pdfx:wic_system_copyright":""}},"totalPages":169},"loc":{"pageNumber":61,"lines":{"from":37,"to":49}}}}],["578",{"pageContent":"62 \n \nProjects explored a range of investment models, including seeking forward investment for \ncarbon or BNG units, and selling available units to buyers thus not needing investment. \nSome projects needed upfront investment to purchase the land where the revenue-\ngenerating activities will be delivered.

The programme will develop a new, consensus-\nbased, UK-wide standards' framework to    provide clarity and structure in nature markets, \nto overcome barriers to investing in nature and the services it provides, and to accelerate \nprogress on environmental goals such as reversing biodiversity loss and achieving net \nzero (BSI, 2023).","metadata":{"source":"/home/node/app/routes/../data/NEIRF/15889_NEIRF_YR_2_REPORT_FINAL_FORMATTED.PDF","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Research report template","Author":"SMITH, Jason","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","CreationDate":"D:20230728131438+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20230728132734+01'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:createdate":"2023-07-28T13:14:38+01:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:creatortool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:58df3b50-f7cf-4ddf-b3d1-4383a53b948e","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4f64431-5c6e-424c-8d99-913a8c07ef77","xmpmm:subject":"26","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"Research report template","dc:description":"","dc:creator":"SMITH, Jason","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","pdf:keywords":"","pdfx:sourcemodified":"","pdfx:company":"","pdfx:comments":"","pdfx:contenttype":"IWP Document","pdfx:contenttypeid":"0x010100A5BF1C78D9F64B679A5EBDE1C6598EBC010055B29FE951C5FD47B141D9D0F82DBC9B","pdfx:_dlc_dociditemguid":"453ced71-93fc-46de-989b-09d563bcdfe0","pdfx:iwporganisationalunit":"3;#DfE|cc08a6d4-dfde-4d0f-bd85-069ebcef80d5","pdfx:iwpowner":"1;#DfE|a484111e-5b24-4ad9-9778-c536c8c88985","pdfx:iwpsubject":"","pdfx:iwpfunction":"","pdfx:iwpsitetype":"","pdfx:iwprightsprotectivemarking":"2;#Official|0884c477-2e62-47ea-b19c-5af6e91124c5","pdfx:informationtype":"","pdfx:distribution":"14;#Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:securityclassification":"","pdfx:hocopyrightlevel":"7;#Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:hogovernmentsecurityclassification":"6;#Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:hositetype":"11;#Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:organisationalunit":"17;#Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:directorate":"","pdfx:lae2bfa7b6474897ab4a53f76ea236c7":"Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:k85d23755b3a46b5a51451cf336b2e9b":"","pdfx:fe59e9859d6a491389c5b03567f5dda5":"Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:cf401361b24e474cb011be6eb76c0e76":"Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:n7493b4506bf40e28c373b1e51a33445":"Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:ddeb1fd0a9ad4436a96525d34737dc44":"Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:taxcatchall":"6;#;#10;#;#9;#;#8;#;#7;#","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_enabled":"true","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_setdate":"2022-04-26T12:36:22Z","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_method":"Standard","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_name":"65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_siteid":"efaa16aa-d1de-4d58-ba2e-2833fdfdd29f","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_actionid":"eff85d9f-09ce-430a-93d0-dd8d7baaac73","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_contentbits":"1","pdfx:mediaserviceimagetags":"","pdfx:lcf76f155ced4ddcb4097134ff3c332f":"","pdfx:order":"468000.000000","pdfx:hofrom":"","pdfx:xd_progid":"","pdfx:complianceassetid":"","pdfx:templateurl":"","pdfx:hocc":"","pdfx:vti_imgdate":"","pdfx:_extendeddescription":"","pdfx:triggerflowinfo":"","pdfx:hoto":"","pdfx:hosubject":"","pdfx:xd_signature":"0","pdfx:wic_system_copyright":""}},"totalPages":169},"loc":{"pageNumber":74,"lines":{"from":1,"to":15}}}}],["619",{"pageContent":"to overcome barriers to investing in nature and the services it provides, and to accelerate \nprogress on environmental goals such as reversing biodiversity loss and achieving net \nzero (BSI, 2023).  \nOne of the nature finance stakeholders interviewed described Defra’s policies around \ndeveloping natural capital markets as ‘radical’, and acknowledged that it is challenging. \nThere were different views about whether additional regulation and guidance from \ngovernment would facilitate natural capital market development: s  ome interviewees felt \nthat government is developing policy gradually so that landowners and other \nstakeholders can be involved; others felt that the lack of clarity is a barrier to landowners \nswitching to nature recovery.   \nThey also felt that additional government funding for programmes like the NEIRF, or \nlarger-scale schemes such as Landscape Recovery,  is needed.

As such, ranges of sold units and revenue estimates can be \nlarge, making robustly modelling future revenue challenging.","metadata":{"source":"/home/node/app/routes/../data/NEIRF/15889_NEIRF_YR_2_REPORT_FINAL_FORMATTED.PDF","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"Research report template","Author":"SMITH, Jason","Subject":"","Keywords":"","Creator":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","Producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","CreationDate":"D:20230728131438+01'00'","ModDate":"D:20230728132734+01'00'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:createdate":"2023-07-28T13:14:38+01:00","xmp:metadatadate":"2023-07-28T13:27:34+01:00","xmp:creatortool":"Acrobat PDFMaker 23 for Word","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:58df3b50-f7cf-4ddf-b3d1-4383a53b948e","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:b4f64431-5c6e-424c-8d99-913a8c07ef77","xmpmm:subject":"26","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"Research report template","dc:description":"","dc:creator":"SMITH, Jason","pdf:producer":"Adobe PDF Library 23.3.20","pdf:keywords":"","pdfx:sourcemodified":"","pdfx:company":"","pdfx:comments":"","pdfx:contenttype":"IWP Document","pdfx:contenttypeid":"0x010100A5BF1C78D9F64B679A5EBDE1C6598EBC010055B29FE951C5FD47B141D9D0F82DBC9B","pdfx:_dlc_dociditemguid":"453ced71-93fc-46de-989b-09d563bcdfe0","pdfx:iwporganisationalunit":"3;#DfE|cc08a6d4-dfde-4d0f-bd85-069ebcef80d5","pdfx:iwpowner":"1;#DfE|a484111e-5b24-4ad9-9778-c536c8c88985","pdfx:iwpsubject":"","pdfx:iwpfunction":"","pdfx:iwpsitetype":"","pdfx:iwprightsprotectivemarking":"2;#Official|0884c477-2e62-47ea-b19c-5af6e91124c5","pdfx:informationtype":"","pdfx:distribution":"14;#Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:securityclassification":"","pdfx:hocopyrightlevel":"7;#Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:hogovernmentsecurityclassification":"6;#Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:hositetype":"11;#Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:organisationalunit":"17;#Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:directorate":"","pdfx:lae2bfa7b6474897ab4a53f76ea236c7":"Official|14c80daa-741b-422c-9722-f71693c9ede4","pdfx:k85d23755b3a46b5a51451cf336b2e9b":"","pdfx:fe59e9859d6a491389c5b03567f5dda5":"Core Defra|026223dd-2e56-4615-868d-7c5bfd566810","pdfx:cf401361b24e474cb011be6eb76c0e76":"Crown|69589897-2828-4761-976e-717fd8e631c9","pdfx:n7493b4506bf40e28c373b1e51a33445":"Team|ff0485df-0575-416f-802f-e999165821b7","pdfx:ddeb1fd0a9ad4436a96525d34737dc44":"Internal Core Defra|836ac8df-3ab9-4c95-a1f0-07f825804935","pdfx:taxcatchall":"6;#;#10;#;#9;#;#8;#;#7;#","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_enabled":"true","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_setdate":"2022-04-26T12:36:22Z","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_method":"Standard","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_name":"65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_siteid":"efaa16aa-d1de-4d58-ba2e-2833fdfdd29f","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_actionid":"eff85d9f-09ce-430a-93d0-dd8d7baaac73","pdfx:msip_label_65bade86-969a-4cfc-8d70-99d1f0adeaba_contentbits":"1","pdfx:mediaserviceimagetags":"","pdfx:lcf76f155ced4ddcb4097134ff3c332f":"","pdfx:order":"468000.000000","pdfx:hofrom":"","pdfx:xd_progid":"","pdfx:complianceassetid":"","pdfx:templateurl":"","pdfx:hocc":"","pdfx:vti_imgdate":"","pdfx:_extendeddescription":"","pdfx:triggerflowinfo":"","pdfx:hoto":"","pdfx:hosubject":"","pdfx:xd_signature":"0","pdfx:wic_system_copyright":""}},"totalPages":169},"loc":{"pageNumber":80,"lines":{"from":1,"to":14}}}}],["642",{"pageContent":"versus a carbon scheme.
