Experimental\ndetermination of N2O emission factors for grazed grassland and arable. To\nquantify through field measurements the N2O emissions from the different land\nuse sectors and major managements within these, according to a range of\nfertiliser and manure N sources. To calculate new EFs based on these new and\nexisting data. During the 2006-2007 season, N2O emissions will be measured on\ngrazed grassland operating at a range of N inputs and at sites with contrasting\nsoil types and climatic regimes. The objective is to obtain accurate values for\nannual N2O emissions from grazed land with which to add to existing data. The\ncombined dataset provides the basis for deriving a statistically significant\nregression of annual N2O emission on N input for fertiliser and/or manures.

To measure N2O emissions from the experimental\ngrassland sites on a temporal â€˜eventâ€™ basis throughout the year dependent\nupon additions of fertiliser and manure, grazing management and incidence of\nrainfall (2 years). 3. To use the results to extract an emission factor for N2O\nfrom inorganic N input for grazed grassland and to improve the significance of\nthe statistics. 4. To setup 3 arable sampling sites in Devon, Cambridshire and\nNottinghamshire with a range of N â€“use levels each, climatic conditions and\nsoil type combinations typical of UK arable land. 5. To measure N2O emissions\nfrom the experimental arable sites on a temporal â€˜eventâ€™ basis throughout\nthe year dependent upon additions of fertiliser and manure, cultivation\nmanagement and incidence of rainfall (2 years). 6. To use the results to extract\nan emission factor for N2O from inorganic N input for arable land and to improve\nthe significance of the statistics. WP 2.

Background The Aarhus Statement on Climate Change recognises that\nall sectors of human activity need to be involved in solutions to climate change\n(Beyond Kyoto, 2009). GHG emissions from ALFM represent approximately 8% of UK\nanthropogenic emissions, mainly as nitrous oxide and methane. Under its Climate\nChange Act of 2008, the UK Government is committed to ambitious targets for\nreducing national emissions by 80% of 1990 levels by 2050, with all significant\nindustrial sources coming under scrutiny. The task of allocating shares of\nfuture reductions falls to the newly appointed Committee on Climate Change,\nwhich needs to consider efficient mitigation potential across a range of\nsectors. The CCC recognises the need to achieve emissions reductions in an\neconomically efficient manner where the cheapest units of greenhouse gas should\nbe abated first. As with other sectors, AFLM emissions abatement needs to be\nachieved at least cost. CCC has adopted a bottom-up Marginal Abatement Cost\nCurve method (MACC) to define cost-effective or efficient abatement potential.\nMore specifically, there exists a notional schedule of costs of implementing\nmitigation measures that shows that some measures can be enacted at a lower cost\nthan other measures. Indeed some measures are thought to be cost saving; i.e.\nfarmers could implement some measures that would simultaneously save money and\nreduce emissions. Thereafter costs rise until some calculation of the costs\nrelative to the benefits of abatement show that further mitigation is less\nworthwhile. This is the essence of the MACC approach, which enables either a\ncost-effectiveness or cost-benefit assessment of measures. The latter by\ncomparing the cost of a measure with the benefit of avoided carbon emission\ndamages - the so-called shadow price of carbon (SPC). Alternatively unit\nabatement costs can be compared with an emissions price prevailing in the\nEuropean Trading Scheme (ETS). Notionally, an efficient budget can be derived\nfrom implementation of measures with reference to mitigation costs in other\nsectors and that cost less than the notional benchmark of the SPC or the ETS\nprice. The CCC has been assisted by Defra and other stakeholder partners in\ndeveloping MACCs and related information on the relevant policy instruments for\ndelivering the identified abatement potential . While demonstrating the\napproximate abatement potential, these projects have nevertheless highlighted\nspecific deficiencies in the way in which the true cost and abatement potential\nof some measures are portrayed. An important point is that full information on\nsome horizon technologies (or RTD) is simply uncertain, warranting further\ninvestigation. The initial MACC project undertaken by this project team\nattempted a basic horizon scale of 2050 RTD potential. However, this exercise\nrequired more time and input than was possible within that project. Other\nimportant challenges with the MACC include the representation of ancillary or\nco-benefits and costs, and the role of full life cycle (LCA upstream or\ndownstream) costs of measures implemented within the farm gate. A further\nsignificant problem relates to the validity of some AP in terms of the current\n(IPCC/UNFCCC) inventory protocol. This project aims to provide a clearer route\nmap for the development of technologies that are not part of the current MACC,\nbut could become so in response to future RTD. The project will identify\nmeasures that could become technically feasible and cost-effective by 2030, and\nthe extent to which their abatement potential could be accounted for in the\nemissions inventory and therefore incorporated in the UK mitigation budget. RTD\nand GHG mitigation There is a growing literature examining the RTD needs for\ngreenhouse gas mitigation (Bosetti et al. 2009; Newell 2008) and the\nrelationship between policy and RTD development and adoption policies. Some of\nthis literature considers the role of reliable global carbon pricing regimes as\na policy and R&D catalyst, or else is focused on the energy sector. A potential\ncarbon price (i.e. trading regimes) in the agricultural sector is one scenario\nfor motivating RTD, but there seem to have been no specific studies to\nunderstand the links between specific policies and RTD. Several studies e.g.\nWeiske (2005), UNFCCC (2008), McKinsey (2009) provide good guides to global AFLM\nabatement options, but the horizons for these studies are not long term and they\nare not specific about how the adoption impacts on actual carbon budgets. In the\nUK, under-investment in R&D has been highlighted as one of the market failures\ncontributing to agricultural GHG emissions (Defra/DECC 2009, p21). RTD can be\nused to achieve GHG mitigation in AFLM through the identification, development\nand demonstration of immature techniques and technologies. This can involve (a)\nimproving understanding of how measures that have been proven elsewhere (e.g.\nnitrification inhibitors) would perform in a UK context; or (b) primary research\ninto nascent measures such as biochar. Technologies featured in the MACC\nexercise were proven (though not always legal). That exercise involved a limited\nhorizon scan and a tentative estimate of AP. We assume the principal objective\nof this project is to further this line of enquiry (i.e. in relation to horizon\ntechnologies). However, we note that RTD can achieve mitigation in other ways\nand that all these should be considered: 1. Making existing measures more\ncost-effective, either by reducing the costs or by increasing the abatement\nrates. For example, the agricultural chemicals industry is currently\ninvestigating ways of making precision farming more cost-effective through the\ndevelopment of cheaper, more accurate machine-mounted N sensors. Part of this\nproject will be to explore the extent of such developments with relevant\nindustry groups. 2. Reducing uncertainty regarding existing\ntechniques/technologies - a measure may be well understood at a field scale,\nhowever assessing its performance at a regional or national scale requires an\nunderstanding of other factors, including: the measure’s performance under a\nvariety of physical conditions and scales; the current baselines, i.e. the\nextent and way in which the measure is applied at present; the economic impact\nof the measure on different farm types. 3. Increasing deployment of mitigation\nmeasures, by identifying and overcoming barriers to uptake. This is particularly\nrelevant to win-win measures (i.e. those that can mitigate while providing a\nfinancial return for the farmer). Evidence indicates that there is significant\nwin-win mitigation potential (Moran et al. 2008), which is not realised due to a\nrange of cognitive, attitudinal, social and policy factors. A more detailed\nunderstanding of the reasons why specific measures are not used within different\nparts the industry (segmented in terms of e.g. age, education level, location,\nfarm size and type) would enable better targeting of existing advisory effort.\nIn summary, RTD can enhance mitigation through: 1. Development and demonstration\nof new techniques. 2. Improving the cost-effectiveness of existing measures. 3.\nReducing key uncertainties regarding the performance of known techniques. 4.\nIncreasing uptake of (win-win) mitigation measures. The measures analysed in\nthis study will generally have to be adopted into pre-existing systems and\ntherefore effectiveness and cost is affected by the interactions between\nmeasures and within system types. It is likely that GHG mitigation will involve\nmultiple changes in management operations. These changes are unlikely to lead to\nadditive reductions in GHG emission, for example use of clover swards in place\nof synthetic N inputs to a grassland would prevent further mitigation by\nimproved fertiliser management. The environment and farming system within which\nmanagement changes occur is also relevant. It is therefore important to consider\nthe measures that can / will be adopted by the different farm systems /\ntypologies. RTD and the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory The maximum\ntechnical and feasible abatement potentials defined in the MACC analysis would\nnot be fully represented in current UK GHG inventory reports. This is because\nthe UK currently uses Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches to estimating emissions as\ndescribed in the IPCC’s guidelines for annual reporting of national GHG\nemissions. Such approaches calculate emissions by multiplying emission factors\nat a regional level (Tier 1) or a national level (Tier 2) by various activities\n(such as the amount of fertiliser N applied). Whilst such approaches are\nwidespread amongst Annexe 1 signatories to the Kyoto Protocol (Lokupitiya and\nPaustian 2006), they are poor at capturing subtle changes in management and its\ninteraction with climate that we know are critically important in controlling\nGHG emissions . For example, IPCC default emission factors (EFs) are unable to\nfully account for genetic changes in cattle that could potentially lead to lower\nmethane emissions (i.e. they are driven by EF x livestock number). The IPCC\nguidelines encourage countries to develop their own country-specific emission\nfactors at Tier 2, or Tier 3. The Tier 3 approach requires a fundamentally\ndifferent approach through the application of spatially explicit process based\nmodels. This is a demanding exercise given the requirement for detailed and\ncarefully documented descriptions of land management and environmental\ncharacteristics. The application of such models also requires a rigorous\nuncertainty analysis and validation against national datasets. However, such\napproaches offer valuable flexibility to account, for example, for reduced\nmethane emissions from any method of enteric fermentation improvement as long as\nestimates are backed by data. The use of DNDC to construct national inventories\nof N2O emission in China showed that overall emission factors were slightly\nlower than the IPCC default value (0.8 rather than 1%). However, there were also\nlarge regional differences which could be important for targeting mitigation\nmeasures (Li et al. 2001). In the UK, Brown et al. (2002) found that N2O\nemissions were 40% lower that IPCC estimates. There is an internationally agreed\nreview procedure for checking that what a country has done is defensible so\nthere is also independent verification. The UK is already well advanced in its\napplication of these models, and needs to consider how they might usefully be\napplied to the preparation of future inventory submissions. Defra and other\nagencies are supportive of the need to improve methodologies in this area, and\nthus on-going work (by North Wyke Research and SAC) is targeting the development\nof Smart Inventories projects currently under way. This work runs parallel to\nsimilar projects being conducted in the other parts of the world for example by\nLandcare in New Zealand and other countries (Lokupitiya and Paustian 2006).\nGiven that this is work in progress, the CCC MACC exercise had to use judgement\nto define allowable mitigation with an overall distinction between direct and\nindirect emissions measures. This distinction was somewhat arbitrary and used\nwith the knowledge that removing indirect measures can have the effect of\nreducing abatement potential by around two thirds. For example, the removal of\nindirect potential from the central feasible potential estimate for 2022 reduced\nthe cumulative abatement from 10.83 MtCO2e to 3.3 MtCO2e. All of this reduction\nis in the crop and soil and livestock abatement potentials. Crop and soil\nabatement potential would reduce from 5.17 MtCO2e to only 154.74 ktCO2e.\nLivestock measures reduce from 3.40 MtCO2e to 2.17 MtCO2e. There is clearly a\nneed to clarify how measures qualify for inclusion in national inventory\nformats. A key questions is how far recent and anticipated refinements in\ninventory methods will allow a more comprehensive recognition of mitigation\noptions to be recognised in the inventory? For example, there is good evidence\nto show that improved soil management can reduce N2O emissions (de Klein and\nLedgard 2005; Ball et al. 2008), and yet such measures would be unlikely to be\nreflected in the inventory. A revised approach to the preparation of inventories\ncould therefore provide a mechanism to account for a wide range of mitigation\nmeasures to be reflected in reports on annual emissions, and would provide\nincentives for policy makers to pursue imaginative solutions to mitigation\noptions. A further benefit from the use of process based models to assess GHG\nbudgets would arise from the potential to include an assessment of carbon\nexchange in the reporting of national sinks and emissions. Article 3.4 of the\nKyoto protocol allows countries to include changes in carbon sinks in their\nnational inventory. In circumstances where land management is being used to\npromote C storage this could have a significant effect on inventories. It has\nbeen estimated that adaptation of measures to increase C storage in crop land\ncould contribute to 31% of the UK’s commitment to reducing GHG emission agreed\nthrough the Kyoto protocol (Smith et al. 2000). At present the UK does not\nreport changes in soil C associated with crop land management, as up to now,\nmethods have not been considered sufficiently reliable. Ammonia emissions lead\nto eutrophication of terrestrial and aquatic environments and can in turn result\nin emissions of nitrous oxide following transformations in these environments.\nThe need to reduce ammonia emissions was recognised by the Gothenburg Protocol\nand proposed emission reductions will also have a beneficial effect in indirect\nemissions of nitrous oxide. On the other hand, there is also potential for\ncertain mitigation methods aimed at reducing ammonia emissions from agriculture\nto lead to enhanced emissions of nitrous oxide (e.g. where reductions in N loss\nfrom livestock manure at one management stage lead to larger amounts of\navailable N being applied to land). It is important therefore that an integrated\napproach is taken in considering potential mitigation methods. The current\nammonia emissions inventory for UK agriculture uses a more detailed approach\nthan the GHG inventory, taking account of management practices, and does have\nthe ability to reflect uptake of many potential mitigation practices (e.g. Webb\nand Misselbrook, 2004). There is an urgent need to reflect this approach within\nthe agricultural GHG inventory and to deal consistently with N flow in both the\nammonia and nitrous oxide inventories. This is being addressed within\nDefra-funded project AC0112 (Ammonia and GHG inventories for UK agriculture).","Project Documents":"FRP - Final Report : AC0214 final report  ","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":12}}}}],["91",{"pageContent":"using marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) data.

However, such\napproaches offer valuable flexibility to account, for example, for reduced\nmethane emissions from any method of enteric fermentation improvement as long as\nestimates are backed by data. The use of DNDC to construct national inventories\nof N2O emission in China showed that overall emission factors were slightly\nlower than the IPCC default value (0.8 rather than 1%). However, there were also\nlarge regional differences which could be important for targeting mitigation\nmeasures (Li et al. 2001). In the UK, Brown et al. (2002) found that N2O\nemissions were 40% lower that IPCC estimates. There is an internationally agreed\nreview procedure for checking that what a country has done is defensible so\nthere is also independent verification. The UK is already well advanced in its\napplication of these models, and needs to consider how they might usefully be\napplied to the preparation of future inventory submissions. Defra and other\nagencies are supportive of the need to improve methodologies in this area, and\nthus on-going work (by North Wyke Research and SAC) is targeting the development\nof Smart Inventories projects currently under way. This work runs parallel to\nsimilar projects being conducted in the other parts of the world for example by\nLandcare in New Zealand and other countries (Lokupitiya and Paustian 2006).\nGiven that this is work in progress, the CCC MACC exercise had to use judgement\nto define allowable mitigation with an overall distinction between direct and\nindirect emissions measures. This distinction was somewhat arbitrary and used\nwith the knowledge that removing indirect measures can have the effect of\nreducing abatement potential by around two thirds. For example, the removal of\nindirect potential from the central feasible potential estimate for 2022 reduced\nthe cumulative abatement from 10.83 MtCO2e to 3.3 MtCO2e. All of this reduction\nis in the crop and soil and livestock abatement potentials. Crop and soil\nabatement potential would reduce from 5.17 MtCO2e to only 154.74 ktCO2e.\nLivestock measures reduce from 3.40 MtCO2e to 2.17 MtCO2e. There is clearly a\nneed to clarify how measures qualify for inclusion in national inventory\nformats. A key questions is how far recent and anticipated refinements in\ninventory methods will allow a more comprehensive recognition of mitigation\noptions to be recognised in the inventory? For example, there is good evidence\nto show that improved soil management can reduce N2O emissions (de Klein and\nLedgard 2005; Ball et al. 2008), and yet such measures would be unlikely to be\nreflected in the inventory. A revised approach to the preparation of inventories\ncould therefore provide a mechanism to account for a wide range of mitigation\nmeasures to be reflected in reports on annual emissions, and would provide\nincentives for policy makers to pursue imaginative solutions to mitigation\noptions. A further benefit from the use of process based models to assess GHG\nbudgets would arise from the potential to include an assessment of carbon\nexchange in the reporting of national sinks and emissions. Article 3.4 of the\nKyoto protocol allows countries to include changes in carbon sinks in their\nnational inventory. In circumstances where land management is being used to\npromote C storage this could have a significant effect on inventories. It has\nbeen estimated that adaptation of measures to increase C storage in crop land\ncould contribute to 31% of the UK’s commitment to reducing GHG emission agreed\nthrough the Kyoto protocol (Smith et al. 2000). At present the UK does not\nreport changes in soil C associated with crop land management, as up to now,\nmethods have not been considered sufficiently reliable. Ammonia emissions lead\nto eutrophication of terrestrial and aquatic environments and can in turn result\nin emissions of nitrous oxide following transformations in these environments.\nThe need to reduce ammonia emissions was recognised by the Gothenburg Protocol\nand proposed emission reductions will also have a beneficial effect in indirect\nemissions of nitrous oxide. On the other hand, there is also potential for\ncertain mitigation methods aimed at reducing ammonia emissions from agriculture\nto lead to enhanced emissions of nitrous oxide (e.g. where reductions in N loss\nfrom livestock manure at one management stage lead to larger amounts of\navailable N being applied to land). It is important therefore that an integrated\napproach is taken in considering potential mitigation methods. The current\nammonia emissions inventory for UK agriculture uses a more detailed approach\nthan the GHG inventory, taking account of management practices, and does have\nthe ability to reflect uptake of many potential mitigation practices (e.g. Webb\nand Misselbrook, 2004). There is an urgent need to reflect this approach within\nthe agricultural GHG inventory and to deal consistently with N flow in both the\nammonia and nitrous oxide inventories. This is being addressed within\nDefra-funded project AC0112 (Ammonia and GHG inventories for UK agriculture).","Project Documents":"FRP - Final Report : AC0214 final report  ","loc":{"lines":{"from":11,"to":23}}}}],["92",{"pageContent":"contribute to mitigation under likely adoption scenarios. 5.

A\nsecond associated objective is to consider how current and emerging abatement\npotential can be reconciled with the protocol for recording emissions in current\nnational inventory methods. This project builds on work carried out to inform\nthe initial agriculture, forestry and land management (AFLM) GHG budget exercise\nundertaken by the Committee on Climate Change (CCC), and a subsequent project to\nconsider how this abatement potential can be delivered by relevant policy\ninstruments. The first of these projects provided a basis for estimating\nefficient abatement potential using marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) data.\nMACCs provide a view of how potential mitigation measures compare in terms of\nthe cost per tonne of emission, as such represent roadmaps for action in the\nfield and for developing policy. However, some of the measures or associated\ntechnologies in the MACC are considered to be more “future” than others. The aim\nof this project is to identify future research and technologies and to consider\nhow and when these might contribute to the ALFM mitigation effort. Specific\nobjectives are to: 1. Review the status of technologies considered in existing\nMACC analysis. 2. Undertake a horizon scanning exercise of the status of these\ntechnologies and future RTD options. 3. Categorise RTD in terms of their likely\nabatement and cost potentials over the relevant budget horizons. 4.

Consider how RTD\ncan be linked to and be fostered by relevant policy/instrument development\nnationally and internationally. This project will be undertaken by a team that\ncombines expertise from previous projects, and with input from a wide range of\nnational and international expert stakeholders. Intermediate and final outputs\nwill be discussed in relevant meetings, including those of the Rural Climate\nChange Forum. Background The Aarhus Statement on Climate Change recognises that\nall sectors of human activity need to be involved in solutions to climate change\n(Beyond Kyoto, 2009). GHG emissions from ALFM represent approximately 8% of UK\nanthropogenic emissions, mainly as nitrous oxide and methane. Under its Climate\nChange Act of 2008, the UK Government is committed to ambitious targets for\nreducing national emissions by 80% of 1990 levels by 2050, with all significant\nindustrial sources coming under scrutiny. The task of allocating shares of\nfuture reductions falls to the newly appointed Committee on Climate Change,\nwhich needs to consider efficient mitigation potential across a range of\nsectors. The CCC recognises the need to achieve emissions reductions in an\neconomically efficient manner where the cheapest units of greenhouse gas should\nbe abated first. As with other sectors, AFLM emissions abatement needs to be\nachieved at least cost. CCC has adopted a bottom-up Marginal Abatement Cost\nCurve method (MACC) to define cost-effective or efficient abatement potential.\nMore specifically, there exists a notional schedule of costs of implementing\nmitigation measures that shows that some measures can be enacted at a lower cost\nthan other measures. Indeed some measures are thought to be cost saving; i.e.\nfarmers could implement some measures that would simultaneously save money and\nreduce emissions. Thereafter costs rise until some calculation of the costs\nrelative to the benefits of abatement show that further mitigation is less\nworthwhile. This is the essence of the MACC approach, which enables either a\ncost-effectiveness or cost-benefit assessment of measures. The latter by\ncomparing the cost of a measure with the benefit of avoided carbon emission\ndamages - the so-called shadow price of carbon (SPC). Alternatively unit\nabatement costs can be compared with an emissions price prevailing in the\nEuropean Trading Scheme (ETS). Notionally, an efficient budget can be derived\nfrom implementation of measures with reference to mitigation costs in other\nsectors and that cost less than the notional benchmark of the SPC or the ETS\nprice. The CCC has been assisted by Defra and other stakeholder partners in\ndeveloping MACCs and related information on the relevant policy instruments for\ndelivering the identified abatement potential . While demonstrating the\napproximate abatement potential, these projects have nevertheless highlighted\nspecific deficiencies in the way in which the true cost and abatement potential\nof some measures are portrayed. An important point is that full information on\nsome horizon technologies (or RTD) is simply uncertain, warranting further\ninvestigation. The initial MACC project undertaken by this project team\nattempted a basic horizon scale of 2050 RTD potential. However, this exercise\nrequired more time and input than was possible within that project. Other\nimportant challenges with the MACC include the representation of ancillary or\nco-benefits and costs, and the role of full life cycle (LCA upstream or\ndownstream) costs of measures implemented within the farm gate. A further\nsignificant problem relates to the validity of some AP in terms of the current\n(IPCC/UNFCCC) inventory protocol. This project aims to provide a clearer route\nmap for the development of technologies that are not part of the current MACC,\nbut could become so in response to future RTD. The project will identify\nmeasures that could become technically feasible and cost-effective by 2030, and\nthe extent to which their abatement potential could be accounted for in the\nemissions inventory and therefore incorporated in the UK mitigation budget. RTD\nand GHG mitigation There is a growing literature examining the RTD needs for\ngreenhouse gas mitigation (Bosetti et al. 2009; Newell 2008) and the\nrelationship between policy and RTD development and adoption policies. Some of\nthis literature considers the role of reliable global carbon pricing regimes as\na policy and R&D catalyst, or else is focused on the energy sector. A potential\ncarbon price (i.e. trading regimes) in the agricultural sector is one scenario\nfor motivating RTD, but there seem to have been no specific studies to\nunderstand the links between specific policies and RTD. Several studies e.g.\nWeiske (2005), UNFCCC (2008), McKinsey (2009) provide good guides to global AFLM\nabatement options, but the horizons for these studies are not long term and they\nare not specific about how the adoption impacts on actual carbon budgets. In the\nUK, under-investment in R&D has been highlighted as one of the market failures\ncontributing to agricultural GHG emissions (Defra/DECC 2009, p21). RTD can be\nused to achieve GHG mitigation in AFLM through the identification, development\nand demonstration of immature techniques and technologies. This can involve (a)\nimproving understanding of how measures that have been proven elsewhere (e.g.\nnitrification inhibitors) would perform in a UK context; or (b) primary research\ninto nascent measures such as biochar. Technologies featured in the MACC\nexercise were proven (though not always legal). That exercise involved a limited\nhorizon scan and a tentative estimate of AP. We assume the principal objective\nof this project is to further this line of enquiry (i.e. in relation to horizon\ntechnologies). However, we note that RTD can achieve mitigation in other ways\nand that all these should be considered: 1. Making existing measures more\ncost-effective, either by reducing the costs or by increasing the abatement\nrates. For example, the agricultural chemicals industry is currently\ninvestigating ways of making precision farming more cost-effective through the\ndevelopment of cheaper, more accurate machine-mounted N sensors. Part of this\nproject will be to explore the extent of such developments with relevant\nindustry groups. 2. Reducing uncertainty regarding existing\ntechniques/technologies - a measure may be well understood at a field scale,\nhowever assessing its performance at a regional or national scale requires an\nunderstanding of other factors, including: the measure’s performance under a\nvariety of physical conditions and scales; the current baselines, i.e. the\nextent and way in which the measure is applied at present; the economic impact\nof the measure on different farm types. 3. Increasing deployment of mitigation\nmeasures, by identifying and overcoming barriers to uptake. This is particularly\nrelevant to win-win measures (i.e. those that can mitigate while providing a\nfinancial return for the farmer). Evidence indicates that there is significant\nwin-win mitigation potential (Moran et al. 2008), which is not realised due to a\nrange of cognitive, attitudinal, social and policy factors. A more detailed\nunderstanding of the reasons why specific measures are not used within different\nparts the industry (segmented in terms of e.g. age, education level, location,\nfarm size and type) would enable better targeting of existing advisory effort.\nIn summary, RTD can enhance mitigation through: 1. Development and demonstration\nof new techniques. 2. Improving the cost-effectiveness of existing measures. 3.\nReducing key uncertainties regarding the performance of known techniques. 4.\nIncreasing uptake of (win-win) mitigation measures. The measures analysed in\nthis study will generally have to be adopted into pre-existing systems and\ntherefore effectiveness and cost is affected by the interactions between\nmeasures and within system types. It is likely that GHG mitigation will involve\nmultiple changes in management operations. These changes are unlikely to lead to\nadditive reductions in GHG emission, for example use of clover swards in place\nof synthetic N inputs to a grassland would prevent further mitigation by\nimproved fertiliser management. The environment and farming system within which\nmanagement changes occur is also relevant. It is therefore important to consider\nthe measures that can / will be adopted by the different farm systems /\ntypologies. RTD and the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory The maximum\ntechnical and feasible abatement potentials defined in the MACC analysis would\nnot be fully represented in current UK GHG inventory reports. This is because\nthe UK currently uses Tier 1 and Tier 2 approaches to estimating emissions as\ndescribed in the IPCC’s guidelines for annual reporting of national GHG\nemissions. Such approaches calculate emissions by multiplying emission factors\nat a regional level (Tier 1) or a national level (Tier 2) by various activities\n(such as the amount of fertiliser N applied). Whilst such approaches are\nwidespread amongst Annexe 1 signatories to the Kyoto Protocol (Lokupitiya and\nPaustian 2006), they are poor at capturing subtle changes in management and its\ninteraction with climate that we know are critically important in controlling\nGHG emissions . For example, IPCC default emission factors (EFs) are unable to\nfully account for genetic changes in cattle that could potentially lead to lower\nmethane emissions (i.e. they are driven by EF x livestock number). The IPCC\nguidelines encourage countries to develop their own country-specific emission\nfactors at Tier 2, or Tier 3. The Tier 3 approach requires a fundamentally\ndifferent approach through the application of spatially explicit process based\nmodels. This is a demanding exercise given the requirement for detailed and\ncarefully documented descriptions of land management and environmental\ncharacteristics. The application of such models also requires a rigorous\nuncertainty analysis and validation against national datasets. However, such\napproaches offer valuable flexibility to account, for example, for reduced\nmethane emissions from any method of enteric fermentation improvement as long as\nestimates are backed by data. The use of DNDC to construct national inventories\nof N2O emission in China showed that overall emission factors were slightly\nlower than the IPCC default value (0.8 rather than 1%).

The emphasis of this project is on\ngaining an understanding of the nature of the risks that might arise to the\npublic interest, their extent and their value, and the policy interventions that\nare then required. A major part of the project is the assessment of the costs\nand benefits of adaptation options. Our analysis is based on the premise that\nDefra wishes to distinguish between market-led adaptations, and those where the\nmarket will fail to protect public good supply. To meet these general aims, the\nfollowing series of objectives and associated tasks apply: 1. Carry out a review\nto estimate future livestock numbers and location This analysis of livestock\nscenarios, predicting future stocks and locations, provides the basis for\nassessing exposure to climate change and is linked to adaptive capacity and\nvulnerability. 2. Develop a range of climate change scenarios A range of climate\nchange scenarios and extreme event assumptions are to be used, downscaled to a\nregional level for the UK. 3. Modelling changes to grassland/forage production\narising from climate change Impacts to grasslands provide a basis for\nunderstanding a range of subsequent impacts in terms of livestock movements,\nnutrition, health, welfare, diffuse pollution and biodiversity. 4. Develop an\nimpacts inventory across key livestock species This inventory will be a mixture\nof quantitative modelling outputs and qualitative assessments. The modelling\nwill involve the integration of biophysical and climate models to understand the\nimpacts on both forage species and disease vectors. 5. Value the impacts\nendpoints in monetary terms Here we aim to convert the impacts into relevant\nmonetary values where possible so as to aid policy-making. This may involve the\nuse of non-market valuation techniques from environmental economics, including\nbenefits transfer. 6. Develop an adaptations inventory This task entails drawing\nup a series of relevant adaptation plans using industry best practice and\ndistinguishing the private and public roles and responsibilities. The inventory\nwill determine the taxonomy of relevant adaptations and their timing. 7. Carry\nout a cost-benefit appraisal of adaptation plans The costs and benefits\nassociated with the adaptation plans are to be estimated and compared with\nrespect to net present values (NPV) and the internal rate of return (IRR)\narising. Sensitivity analysis is to be undertaken to allow us to determine the\neffect of extreme event assumptions and the sensitivity of specific cost and\nbenefit assumptions . 8. Appraise the distributional implications of efficient\nadaptation plans The NPV and IRR figures are proxies for economic efficiency,\nbut do not account for any distributional and/or equity impacts arising, i.e.\nwho are the winners and losers and how vulnerable are they to the patterns of\npossible public adaptation. This task explicitly integrates vulnerability\nanalysis with the conventional economic measures of performance. 9. Provide\nrecommendations on ‘optimal’ adaptation in the UK livestock sector. This task\nsynthesises the outcomes of tasks 6 to 8 and provides a synopsis of our key\nfindings with respect to the alternative adaptation plans. 10.

Suitable sites/habitat\ncombinations may include, for example, ECN sites in Natura areas or other\nprotected areas, or sites in the newly established Natural England Long-term\nMonitoring Network, or long-term experimental sites. Those which show good\ncorrespondence with Annex I habitats or priority habitats (e.g. see\ncorrespondence tables at\nhttp://jncc.defra.gov.uk/files/NBNdictionary_habitat_correspondances_20080205.zip\no preferably with a widespread geographic coverage Task 2 • Collate information\non approaches taken by other Member States, where they have defined metrics or\nmeasures to assess impacts on habitats in relation to defined desired status or\nrelated work. For example, in Germany and the Netherlands soil-vegetation linked\nmodels have been used to calculate critical loads for Annex I habitats (e.g. see\nvan Hinsberg and van Dobben, 2011; Slootweg et al, 2010), and consider whether\nthe approaches are applicable to the UK. • Collate information on the current\nsoil-vegetation models available in the UK to identify for the selected habitats\nwhat response variables/habitat attributes they are able to predict or define\nthe environmental suitability for (e.g. grass:forb ratio, suitability for\nspecies) and what the constraints are. • Briefly review current approaches for\ndefining habitat status/condition and consider approaches for scoring importance\nof species or other variables for habitats, for example based on species\nscarcity or ecological function. • Produce options for an approach defining a\nmetric and provide illustrations. The precise metric may be site specific or may\nbe generic to a habitat type. • Consult JNCC and the statutory country nature\nconservation bodies on these options; ensure that the context and purpose is\nfully described, in order to choose, possibly after refinement, a recommended\napproach. In their tender, potential contractors should suggest how they will\nconsult the conservation bodies; a workshop is one approach, but contractors may\nwish to put forward alternatives, such as bilateral meetings with informal\ninter-agency habitat groups and with JNCC. Task 3 • Provide a report of Tasks 1\nand 2. This report should provide a recommended approach for defining a metric\nand provide examples of its application and examples of sites at which it can be\napplied; it should provide a justification of the approach and set it in the\ncontext of the objectives for biodiversity of the UK, England and the devolved\nadministrations.

Specifically this includes the work of\nthe UN ECE, for example the current review of the Gothenburg protocol; and\nevolving legislation from the Clean Air For Europe (CAFÉ programme) of the EC\nand impending review of the National Emissions Ceilings Directive. The work will\ninvolve close scrutiny of the technical input to these developments;\nascertaining and analyzing the implications for the UK, and investigating the\nassumptions and uncertainties; and assembling evidence that can be used by Defra\nin deciding its own policy and to influence the international fora. In order to\nachieve this objective our aim has been to bring together a wide range of\nexpertise in this consortium spanning pollutant emissions and emission\nprojections, atmospheric modelling on scales from local and urban to global,\ncriteria for environmental protection and human health, and on potential\nmeasures to reduce emissions and associated costs. The research will build on\nprevious contracts that have developed “integrated assessment modelling” ,\nbringing this disparate information together to investigate cost effective\nstrategies for pollution control that maximize improvements in environmental\nprotection; closely paralleling the approach used by the EC and UNECE based on\nthe work of IIASA and EMEP. We shall also take a broad perspective, recognising\nlinks with other environmental problems such as control of greenhouse gases. The\nresearch is divided into 3 work packages:- Work package 1 The objective of work\npackage 1 is investigation of pollutant emission scenarios and potential\nabatement strategies at the UK, regional and urban scales. This includes\nconsideration of energy scenarios, transport scenarios and urban air quality,\nand agriculture in the UK; also shipping emissions in the seas surrounding the\nUK which are of increasing importance. There are many sub-tasks in this\nwork-package aimed at assembling the required information, adapting and\nextending capabilities of the UKIAM model (for example to broader treatment of\nthe nitrogen cycle as well as addressing synergies between control of air\nquality pollutants and greenhouse gases): and to exploring uncertainties and the\nrobustness of conclusions. Work package 2 Work package 2 is concentrated on the\nEuropean scale. The aims are first to undertake complementary modelling to that\nundertaken by IIASA and EMEP to address aspects not considered and investigate\nthe effect of various assumptions; secondly a series of supporting tasks to\nimprove atmospheric modelling, undertake model intercomparisons, and establish\nsource apportionment. Thirdly we aim to scrutinize in detail work for the EC and\nUN ECE with the GAINS model and resulting proposals for national emission\nceilings, and to contribute to task forces and working groups including\nchairmanship of the Task Force on Measurements and Modelling. Work Package 3 The\nobjectives of this work package are to assess the contributions to UK and\nEuropean air quality from global-scale transport of pollution from other\ncontinents. This work package will address global-scale implications of emission\nand climate scenarios, and then consider their effects on the regional scale.\nThis will include quantifying the impacts of changing global transport patterns,\nprincipally shipping and road transport, and the impact of climate change on\nnatural global emissions. In each case the objective is to assess the impact on\nUK and European air quality. As well as air quality and human health impacts,\nthe objective of this work package is also to quantify the impacts of pollution\ndeposition on ecosystems. Principle pollutants that will be considered are\nozone, nitrogen (oxidised and reduce) and sulphate. The emission pulse technique\ndeveloped previously will be further used under task 3.2 to create\nsource-receptor relationships for ozone and particulate matter (PM). These\nrelationships would then be included in the integrated assessment modelling\nunder work package 1 of this tender. Under work package 3.3 the formation and\ntransport of these species, and their role in the eutrophication and\nacidification of ecosystems will be investigated.

Specifically this includes the work of\nthe UN ECE, for example the current review of the Gothenburg protocol; and\nevolving legislation from the Clean Air For Europe (CAFÉ programme) of the EC\nand impending review of the National Emissions Ceilings Directive. The work will\ninvolve close scrutiny of the technical input to these developments;\nascertaining and analyzing the implications for the UK, and investigating the\nassumptions and uncertainties; and assembling evidence that can be used by Defra\nin deciding its own policy and to influence the international fora. In order to\nachieve this objective our aim has been to bring together a wide range of\nexpertise in this consortium spanning pollutant emissions and emission\nprojections, atmospheric modelling on scales from local and urban to global,\ncriteria for environmental protection and human health, and on potential\nmeasures to reduce emissions and associated costs. The research will build on\nprevious contracts that have developed “integrated assessment modelling” ,\nbringing this disparate information together to investigate cost effective\nstrategies for pollution control that maximize improvements in environmental\nprotection; closely paralleling the approach used by the EC and UNECE based on\nthe work of IIASA and EMEP. We shall also take a broad perspective, recognising\nlinks with other environmental problems such as control of greenhouse gases. The\nresearch is divided into 3 work packages:- Work package 1 The objective of work\npackage 1 is investigation of pollutant emission scenarios and potential\nabatement strategies at the UK, regional and urban scales. This includes\nconsideration of energy scenarios, transport scenarios and urban air quality,\nand agriculture in the UK; also shipping emissions in the seas surrounding the\nUK which are of increasing importance. There are many sub-tasks in this\nwork-package aimed at assembling the required information, adapting and\nextending capabilities of the UKIAM model (for example to broader treatment of\nthe nitrogen cycle as well as addressing synergies between control of air\nquality pollutants and greenhouse gases): and to exploring uncertainties and the\nrobustness of conclusions. Work package 2 Work package 2 is concentrated on the\nEuropean scale. The aims are first to undertake complementary modelling to that\nundertaken by IIASA and EMEP to address aspects not considered and investigate\nthe effect of various assumptions; secondly a series of supporting tasks to\nimprove atmospheric modelling, undertake model intercomparisons, and establish\nsource apportionment. Thirdly we aim to scrutinize in detail work for the EC and\nUN ECE with the GAINS model and resulting proposals for national emission\nceilings, and to contribute to task forces and working groups including\nchairmanship of the Task Force on Measurements and Modelling. Work Package 3 The\nobjectives of this work package are to assess the contributions to UK and\nEuropean air quality from global-scale transport of pollution from other\ncontinents. This work package will address global-scale implications of emission\nand climate scenarios, and then consider their effects on the regional scale.\nThis will include quantifying the impacts of changing global transport patterns,\nprincipally shipping and road transport, and the impact of climate change on\nnatural global emissions. In each case the objective is to assess the impact on\nUK and European air quality. As well as air quality and human health impacts,\nthe objective of this work package is also to quantify the impacts of pollution\ndeposition on ecosystems. Principle pollutants that will be considered are\nozone, nitrogen (oxidised and reduce) and sulphate. The emission pulse technique\ndeveloped previously will be further used under task 3.2 to create\nsource-receptor relationships for ozone and particulate matter (PM). These\nrelationships would then be included in the integrated assessment modelling\nunder work package 1 of this tender.

The work will\ninvolve close scrutiny of the technical input to these developments;\nascertaining and analyzing the implications for the UK, and investigating the\nassumptions and uncertainties; and assembling evidence that can be used by Defra\nin deciding its own policy and to influence the international fora. In order to\nachieve this objective our aim has been to bring together a wide range of\nexpertise in this consortium spanning pollutant emissions and emission\nprojections, atmospheric modelling on scales from local and urban to global,\ncriteria for environmental protection and human health, and on potential\nmeasures to reduce emissions and associated costs. The research will build on\nprevious contracts that have developed “integrated assessment modelling” ,\nbringing this disparate information together to investigate cost effective\nstrategies for pollution control that maximize improvements in environmental\nprotection; closely paralleling the approach used by the EC and UNECE based on\nthe work of IIASA and EMEP. We shall also take a broad perspective, recognising\nlinks with other environmental problems such as control of greenhouse gases. The\nresearch is divided into 3 work packages:- Work package 1 The objective of work\npackage 1 is investigation of pollutant emission scenarios and potential\nabatement strategies at the UK, regional and urban scales. This includes\nconsideration of energy scenarios, transport scenarios and urban air quality,\nand agriculture in the UK; also shipping emissions in the seas surrounding the\nUK which are of increasing importance. There are many sub-tasks in this\nwork-package aimed at assembling the required information, adapting and\nextending capabilities of the UKIAM model (for example to broader treatment of\nthe nitrogen cycle as well as addressing synergies between control of air\nquality pollutants and greenhouse gases): and to exploring uncertainties and the\nrobustness of conclusions. Work package 2 Work package 2 is concentrated on the\nEuropean scale. The aims are first to undertake complementary modelling to that\nundertaken by IIASA and EMEP to address aspects not considered and investigate\nthe effect of various assumptions; secondly a series of supporting tasks to\nimprove atmospheric modelling, undertake model intercomparisons, and establish\nsource apportionment. Thirdly we aim to scrutinize in detail work for the EC and\nUN ECE with the GAINS model and resulting proposals for national emission\nceilings, and to contribute to task forces and working groups including\nchairmanship of the Task Force on Measurements and Modelling. Work Package 3 The\nobjectives of this work package are to assess the contributions to UK and\nEuropean air quality from global-scale transport of pollution from other\ncontinents. This work package will address global-scale implications of emission\nand climate scenarios, and then consider their effects on the regional scale.\nThis will include quantifying the impacts of changing global transport patterns,\nprincipally shipping and road transport, and the impact of climate change on\nnatural global emissions. In each case the objective is to assess the impact on\nUK and European air quality. As well as air quality and human health impacts,\nthe objective of this work package is also to quantify the impacts of pollution\ndeposition on ecosystems. Principle pollutants that will be considered are\nozone, nitrogen (oxidised and reduce) and sulphate. The emission pulse technique\ndeveloped previously will be further used under task 3.2 to create\nsource-receptor relationships for ozone and particulate matter (PM). These\nrelationships would then be included in the integrated assessment modelling\nunder work package 1 of this tender. Under work package 3.3 the formation and\ntransport of these species, and their role in the eutrophication and\nacidification of ecosystems will be investigated.

It is also an\noffence under section 23 to acquire an “unauthorised fuel” for use within a\nsmoke control area unless its used on an appliance “exempted” by the Secretary\nof State under section 21 from the controls which generally apply in those\nareas. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and\nSecretaries of State in the devolved administrations for Scotland and Wales have\npowers under the Act to make regulations to authorise fuels for use in smoke\ncontrol areas in their respective countries and to make orders exempting\nspecific appliance to enable the burning of “unauthorised fuels i.e. inherently\nsmoky fuels such as house coal or wood. It is therefore a legal requirement that\nall fuel sold or used in a smoke control area and all appliances sold or used to\nburn an unauthorised fuel in a smoke control area have been given legal status\nin a Statutory Instrument signed by the Secretary of State. Before making\nregulations or orders the Secretary of State must first be certain that the fuel\ncan burn on an open grate without producing smoke and that a specific appliance\ncan burn a particular unauthorised fuel without producing any smoke or a\nsubstantial quantity of smoke. The Department and the devolved administrations\ndo not have the facilities or technical expertise to undertake such work.\nWithout such prior testing, the Secretary of State is unable to consider the use\nof the powers in the Act. In that case, manufactures of these products would be\nunable to market their fuels and appliances in smoke control areas without\nmaking their customers liable to prosecution under the Act by the local\nauthority.
