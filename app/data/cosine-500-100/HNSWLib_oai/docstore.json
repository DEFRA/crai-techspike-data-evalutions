One of the key\ncommitments was to connect people with the environment, as a significant body of\nevidence shows that spending time in nature improves health and wellbeing. As\npart of this commitment, specific actions were outlined to encourage children to\nbecome closer to nature and to help children and young people from all\nbackgrounds to engage with nature and improve their environment. To facilitate\nthese actions, £10 million was made available by the Department for Education\n(DfE) to fund the Children and Nature Programme with the aim of supporting\nchildren, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, to have better\naccess to natural environments. The three Children and Nature Programme funded\nprojects were: Nature Friendly Schools, Growing Care Farming, and Community\nForest and Woodland Outreach. Nature Friendly Schools was independently\nevaluated by NatCen Social Research. Independent evaluations were not\ncommissioned for the other two projects. The overall aim of the Nature Friendly\nSchools (NFS) intervention was to promote positive mental health and wellbeing\nfor children and young people, improve pupils’ feelings of connection with\nschool, and encourage their connection with nature, through the supported\ndelivery of high-quality outdoor learning activities. The Resilience Through\nNature (RTN) Consortium was awarded a grant to develop and deliver NFS from\n2019-20 to 2021-22. The RTN Consortium included: Royal Society of Wildlife\nTrusts (Lead), six Wildlife Trusts, YoungMinds, Groundwork UK, the Sensory Trust\nand the Field Studies Council. Schools were recruited onto the project across\nEngland. The main eligibility criterion was that at least 30% of the pupils were\neligible for Free School Meals. The objectives of NFS were: - Objective 1: To\nsupport target schools to establish greener school grounds or to deliver a\nprogramme of progressive regular off-site visits in natural environments, or\nboth; - Objective 2: To enable school staff to deliver the quality and range of\nactivities needed to support delivery of benefits for children’s mental health\nand wellbeing, their engagement with learning and other programme outcomes; -\nObjective 3: To gather evidence to complete project monitoring and project\nreporting and to support programme evaluation. To achieve these objectives, NFS\nactivities were delivered through the following intervention pathways: greening\nschool grounds, progressive off-site visits (including residentials), or a\ncombination: - Greening School Grounds: Natural areas co-developed with schools\nand pupils based on available space; - Progressive off-site visits: Developed\nand supported by the Education Officer, day trips (focused on local areas and\nutilising a network of local landowners, volunteers, and centres) and\nresidential visits (including overnight stays); - A combination of Greening\nSchool Grounds and Progressive off-site visits: planned for a small proportion\nof schools. NFS delivery and evaluation evolved over the delivery period.\nChanges made were largely due to the need to adapt through the COVID-19\npandemic, but also in response to schools’ feedback. The most notable changes\nwere that by the final year all schools received the Greening School Grounds\nintervention and funds for purchasing outdoor equipment with off-site visits on\noffer as an optional add-on intervention. In addition to being more practically\nfeasible in the context of the pandemic, the Greening School Grounds\nintervention was particularly popular among schools who saw the intervention as\nan opportunity for sustainable, positive impact for their school. Schools were\nrequired to select a ‘Lead Teacher’ who would receive most of the training and\nsupport, and who was responsible for collaboratively designing and implementing\nthe intervention for their school. Lead Teachers were supported by a designated\nEducation Officer (EO). The intervention was delivered in two phases: a\nsupported phase, where schools were provided bespoke support by EOs and an\nindependent phase, where teachers were expected to implement the development\nplan, designed with support from their EO, and promote the embedding of what\nthey had learned about outdoor learning throughout their school. Over the two\nyears of NFS delivery, 190 schools across England were recruited onto the NFS\nwith 181 remaining engaged throughout the delivery period. Evaluation\nmethodology A randomised control trial (RCT) evaluation design was piloted in\nthe first delivery year. The NFS Evaluation Learning Report presents learning\nfrom the RCT pilot and key considerations for designing a trial for NFS or other\nsimilar outdoor learning programme. However, due to disruption caused by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, it was cancelled for year 2 and the evaluation was\nre-designed to be an implementation, process, and outcome evaluation using a\nmixed-method design. Qualitative data were collected through: - Interviews and\nfocus groups with lead teachers and additional school staff, delivery partners,\nand pupils; - Observations of teacher training sessions and outdoor learning\nactivities with pupils. Quantitative data were collected through: - Monitoring\ndata of recruitment and delivery of NFS training and interventions; - A pre-post\npupil outcome survey measuring mental health and wellbeing, connection to\nschool, and connection to nature.","Project Documents":"SUP - Supplementary Report : NFS Evaluation Learning Report (4300k) ","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":2}}}}],["4",{"pageContent":"The project is to evaluate the Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund,\nincluding reviews of the processes, impact, and Value for Money of NEIRF-funded\nprojects.
