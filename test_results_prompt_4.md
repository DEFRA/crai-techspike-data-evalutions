"Based on the provided [DOCUMENT], I have extracted key textual and numeric information. Here are the points of interest:\n\n**Number of NEIRF Projects Funded:** Not explicitly mentioned in the document, but it can be inferred that at least 29 Round 1 projects and 56 out of 57 Round 2 projects received funding.\n\n**Other Key Points:**\n\n* The majority of projects (7/10) strongly agreed or agreed that the NEIRF grant helped them gain a greater understanding of sellers.\n* A similar proportion of respondents (22% strongly agree, 45% agree) credited NEIRF with helping develop relationships with sellers.\n\nPlease note that the document does not provide information on how many projects have been funded in total.

Points of Interest:**\n\n1. **Recommendations for Future NEIRF Projects**: No specific recommendations are mentioned in the provided document, but it does highlight the importance of piloting innovative funding and delivery mechanisms, including private payments for ecosystem services.\n\n2. **Scalability and Replicability**: The project modeling for the pilot site is replicable across other lowland and fen peatland sites in England, with the goal of contributing to the development and scale of market infrastructure and policy supporting investment in lowland peatland habitats.\n\n3. **Project Completion Rates**: Out of 29 Round 1 projects, all completed a baseline self-assessment, while 16 projects submitted end-point self-assessments. In Round 2, 56 out of 57 projects completed a baseline self-assessment, and 15 projects completed mid-point self-assessments.\n\n4. **Market Analysis**: An initial requirement for future projects is to conduct a market analysis of buyers, highlighting the importance of understanding buyer demand in ecosystem services.\n\n5. **Community of Practice (CoP)**: Projects strongly valued the CoP, with a suggestion to hold in-person events and peer learning activities involving site visits to facilitate interaction and networking among grantees.\n\nNote: These points of interest are based on the provided document and do not infer any additional information.
