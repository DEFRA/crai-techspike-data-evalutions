Points of Interest**\n\n1. **NEIRF Projects**: Two NEIRF projects aim to directly enable private payments for ecosystem services, with the potential to generate income through multiple streams.\n2. **Lapwing Estate Project**: This project has developed a novel business model to generate sustainable energy, food, and rewet peatland, with the potential to cost up to Â£1 billion and require novel sources of investment.\n3. **Challenges and Uncertainties**: Emerging policies may create uncertainties, requiring flexibility in business models to adapt to changes.\n4. **Benchmarking Ecosystem Services**: A benchmark is needed to recognize methodologies as sufficiently robust and credible, with the goal of preventing greenwashing.\n\n**Additional Insights**\n\n* Extensive stakeholder engagement and collaboration are key to ensuring needs are mapped and challenges addressed across different sites.\n* Developing a financing model based on multiple pilot projects allows for transition from conceptual thinking to realities on the ground.\n* Training is provided on how to use the financial model, supporting ongoing work in developing assumptions, analyzing site characteristics, and replicating the overall approach.
