Two NEIRF projects that were funded are:

* The Greater Manchester Environment Fund (GMEF) project, which aimed to develop the case for investment into lowland peatland restoration in Greater Manchester. This project was supported by a NEIRF grant.
* The Community Investment and Cooperation for Ecological Regeneration in Lancashire project, which is led by the Ribble Rivers Trust. This project aims to promote ecological regeneration through community investment and cooperation.

The two main projects within the Nature's Evidence Investment Readiness Fund (NEIRF) focus on habitat banking and attracting private investments for biodiversity initiatives. The habitat banking approach involves creating, restoring or enhancing habitats to generate credits that can be sold after demonstrating a measurable uplift in biodiversity. This model is being expanded beyond owned lands by the organization and may seek further investor funding in the future.

In terms of attracting private investments, NEIRcu projects have been engaging with potential buyers interested in carbon units and exploring various types of investment arrangements. Some projects without secured funding still discussed their business plans with potential investors, resulting in varying outcomes based on these conversations

mistral
=======
The two NEIRF projects aim to enable private payments for ecosystem services by instigating methodologies for environmental monetization, and creating platforms that can apply at a landscape or national level. One project, Green, has already completed its work and shows progress in identifying and working with buyers of ecosystem services, although more than a quarter of milestones have not been fully met. The other project, yet to be completed, is focused on co-designing and testing how potential elements of three environmental land management schemes (Sustainable Farming Incentive, Countryside Stewardship, and Landscape Recovery) work in real-life environments with different user groups, across various geographies and sectors. The project is also working with Natural England on Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG), and was selected to be one of Natural England’s statutory biodiversity credits pilots in preparation for mandatory BNG. Further details on the approach to initial scoping, baselining, and estimating ecosystem services can be found in case studies from the Green Finance Institute.

http://localhost:3000/query?q=What%20recommendations%20have%20been%20made%20for%20future%20NEIRF%20projects?

lama3
=====
The recommendations for future NEIRF projects are to provide flexible funding that can help unlock and establish profitable business models. This is critical for catalysing further impact investments. Additionally, there is a need for Government to look to provide technical support to help drive forward policy developments and ensure that there are systems and mechanisms in place to cost Biodiversity Net Gain correctly and distribute it effectively.

phi:medium
==========
Based on the information provided in the context section, recommendations for future NEIRF projects include developing robust finance models to attract private investment and exploring habitat banking approaches. Additionally, understanding key drivers such as policy developments and landowners' attitudes can help shape more impactful outcomes. Learning from Round  cuestion
1 grantees on how they utilized their NEIRF grants could also provide valuable insights for future projects.

mistral
=======
Future NEIRF projects could consider recommendations such as exploring innovative funding and delivery mechanisms for ecosystem services, including private payments. Additionally, the potential exists to seek investor funding to scale up a habitat banking approach on land not owned by SWT. Interviews with policy leads in government and other stakeholders will also be conducted to explore other initiatives that aim to realize the ambition of private sector investment, which may provide lessons for addressing barriers and uncertainties within NEIRF projects. It is important to note that as projects continue to develop their business cases, we are aware of other areas of uncertainty that may impact work programmes, such as water quality permitting, interaction of carbon, BNG, ELM services, and the ability to 'stack' them for sale to different buyers, as well as tax treatment of environmental services. These areas will be further explored as projects progress.

gemma
=======
The provided text suggests the following recommendations for future NEIRF projects:

- Foster collaboration between stakeholders including buyers, sellers, investors, policymakers, and data providers to establish effective intermediaries in natural capital markets.


- Highlight the value of NbS to consumers through initiatives like RAWES method to promote investment.


- Implement Natural Capital Investment Companies (NCICs) to secure funding for a diverse range of NbS projects, addressing issues like flood mitigation, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration.


- Utilize Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) to manage multiple farming clusters, facilitating the trading of environmental outcomes and regulatory compliance.


- Define standard projects based on specific habitats or locations to assess their natural capital potential using NEIRF.



http://localhost:3000/query?q=What%20support%20is%20available%20for%20NEIRF%20project%20applications?

=====
Support available for NEIRF project applications:

The New Economic Incentives for Restoring Ecosystems (NEIRF) fund provides support for projects that aim to restore ecosystems. As per your request, you are seeking information on the support available for NEIRF project applications.

According to the context provided, NEIRF funding has been valuable in enabling grantees to deliver their projects. The Fund gave them the opportunity to dedicate necessary time and resources to implement their ideas, which would not have been possible otherwise. Additionally, NEIRF funding allowed projects to benefit from one-to-one contact with the Environment Agency (EA) as an opportunity to directly feed into policy development.

In terms of specific support available for project applications, it appears that grantees valued the interactive webinars and Community of Practice groups facilitated by NEIRF. These initiatives fostered connections among funded projects, enabling them to share experiences and best practices.

It is worth noting that delays in government-level decisions have impacted some projects' ability to design long-term business plans or develop Carbon Codes at the desired pace. Nevertheless, NEIRF funding has been instrumental in supporting projects to deliver their objectives and outcomes.

phi:medium
==========
Based on the information provided in the context document, it appears there isn't specific support mentioned for NEIRF project applications. However, the context does outline a finance model and an approach towards habitat banking where units are sold after achieving biodiversity uplift. It also mentions potential investor funding to scale up these efforts on non-owned land by SWT.

For NEIRF project support, it would be advisable for interested parties to explore the possibilities of this finance model and consider habitat banking as a means to generate revenue while contributing to biodiversity goals. Additionally, seeking investor funding could potentially enhance the scope and impact of their projects beyond initial capacities.

If you require more detailed guidance on NEIRF project applications or specific support mechanisms, I recommend directly contacting the responsible department at Defra for further assistance.

mistral
=======
Regarding your inquiry about support for NEIRF project applications, we would like to share some insights that might be helpful:

1. Sharing costs and resources across projects can lead to cost efficiency and attract a wider variety of investors. This is achieved by creating Habitat Bank Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) where the costs can be shared among participating projects.

2. In-house capacity when setting up a project is beneficial, as it allows for increased skill development and long-term benefits within your organization.

3. Engaging in ecosystem service markets can support the resilience of environmental NGOs and contribute to additional conservation activities.

4. Third-party landowners are essential in creating a habitat restoration pipeline, as organizations may only meet 20-25% of estimated land demand over the next 10 years. Therefore, third-party land will be required to meet demand.

5. The use of Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) units in project applications is an innovative approach that can help you demonstrate how your project contributes positively to local biodiversity. The calculation used in these calculations are based on the biodiversity units lost within a relevant development area, the net gain requirement and the proportion of BNG delivered onsite.

For more detailed information about NEIRF projects or questions regarding application support, please contact NEIRF@environment-agency.gov.uk. If you have specific inquiries about The Carbon Bank project, please get in touch with James Dingle, Carbon Bank Partnership Manager at James.Dingle@ecotricity.co.uk.
