Based on the provided [DOCUMENT], I can summarise 2 NEIRF projects as follows:\n\n1. LAPWING ESTATE:\n\t* Developed a complex and novel business model to generate sustainable energy, food, and rewet peatland.\n\t* Has potential to generate income through multiple streams, balancing risk of market infancies and regulatory/policy changes.\n\t* Expanding to landscape-scale land use change, one of the first in the UK, with a potential cost of up to £1 billion.\n2. No second project is mentioned or summarised in the provided [DOCUMENT].

Based on the provided [DOCUMENT] and [CONTEXT], I found a data table that contains costs related to NEIRF projects. Here are some numerical data points extracted from the document:\n\n* Indicative £40 million investment over time for habitat enhancement across 108ha in Plymouth.\n* Initial target of £1.5 million for biodiversity units.\n\nPlease note that these figures seem to be related to the revenue stream, rather than direct costs. I was unable to find any specific cost data points within the provided document. If you would like me to look further or provide additional insights based on this information, please let me know!
